Triumph BRM Companion App

Business Revenue Model Companion for Triumph Business Solutions

⸻

1) Product Overview

The Triumph BRM Companion App is a cross-platform system (web + mobile) that helps Triumph Business Solutions clients navigate and execute the Business Revenue Models (BRM) framework.

It guides clients step-by-step through four BRM levels, enabling them to design, implement, and optimize revenue models while integrating coach feedback, milestone tracking, and data-driven improvement.

Core Promise:
Structure → Execution → Insight → Scale.

Platforms:
	•	Web (Vercel)
	•	Mobile (React Native via Expo)
	•	Backend (Supabase – PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)

⸻

2) Program Context

BRM Levels

Level	Focus	Duration	Outcome
1. Attraction Models	Generate leads & validate offer	3–6 months	Reliable front-end demand
2. Upsell Models	Increase average order value	3–4 months	Higher AOV + margin
3. Downsell Models	Capture otherwise lost sales	3–4 months	Improved conversion rate
4. Continuity Models	Increase retention & LTV	3–4 months	Predictable recurring revenue

Each level builds upon the prior one. Access is tier-gated based on the client’s purchased program.

⸻

3) Core Feature Map
	1.	Model Ideation Wizard – guided brainstorming with AI prompts aligned to Triumph frameworks.
	2.	Plan Generator – produces a task-based roadmap for each model.
	3.	KPI Tracking & Dashboard – real-time Supabase metrics synced from integrated platforms.
	4.	Stops & Gates – milestone locks that prevent skipping critical steps.
	5.	Coach Workspace – enables review, feedback, and approvals.
	6.	Adaptive Suggestions Engine – analyzes KPI deviations and proposes next actions.
	7.	Exportable Model Plan – one-click PDF or JSON summaries.
	8.	Notifications & Nudges – progress reminders and alerts.

⸻

4) Level Structure

Level 1 — Attraction

Goal: Create validated lead-generation systems.
Milestones: ICP Clarity → Offer Hook → Funnel Build → Traffic Test → Message-Market Fit.

Levels 2 & 3 — Upsell + Downsell

Goal: Maximize revenue per customer.
Milestones: Value Ladder → Offer Stack → Checkout Flow → A/B Test → Optimize AOV.

Level 4 — Continuity

Goal: Build stable recurring revenue.
Milestones: Tier Design → Onboarding → Retention Flows → Churn Prevention → Scale.

Each milestone = specific Definition of Done (DoD) validated by coach approval.

⸻

5) Roles & Permissions
	•	Owner: full access, model creation, and KPI input.
	•	Team: limited task view/edit.
	•	Coach: approve gates, add notes, unlock levels.
	•	Admin: system management and analytics.

RBAC enforced through Supabase’s Row-Level Security (RLS) and policies.

⸻

6) Data & Storage Model
	•	Supabase Tables: clients, models, plans, milestones, tasks, kpis, suggestions, notes.
	•	Storage: file uploads (assets, templates, reports).
	•	Auth: Supabase Auth with roles (Owner, Coach, Admin).
	•	Real-time: Supabase Realtime channels for progress updates.

⸻

7) Supabase + Vercel Architecture
	•	Frontend: React/Next.js (Vercel) using Supabase client SDK.
	•	Backend: Supabase Database + Edge Functions for logic (AI calls, KPI triggers, gate validation).
	•	AI Layer: Codex (OpenAI) via Vercel Edge Functions.
	•	Deployment:
	•	Push to main → deploys web via Vercel.
	•	Supabase migrations run automatically.

⸻

8) Codex Integration

Codex reads this README to understand:
	•	App goals (BRM methodology).
	•	Structure (Levels, Milestones, Gates).
	•	Data entities (Model, Plan, Milestone, Task, KPI).
	•	AI prompt intents (ideation, diagnosis, feedback).

Codex should auto-scaffold:
	•	CRUD API endpoints.
	•	Supabase schema definitions.
	•	React component shells for dashboard and model builder.
	•	Basic automation rules for “Stops” and KPI triggers.

⸻

9) Key Entities

Client → has many Models
Model → belongs to a Level and contains a Plan
Plan → holds Milestones
Milestone → contains Tasks
Task → linked to KPI data & assets
KPI → numeric metrics per Model
Suggestion → AI-generated improvement
CoachNote → human feedback

⸻

10) Workflow Overview
	1.	Client logs in → sees Levels unlocked.
	2.	Creates Model via Ideation Wizard.
	3.	App generates Plan + Milestones.
	4.	Tasks auto-populate → client works through them.
	5.	KPIs entered manually or via integrations.
	6.	If results underperform → AI triggers Suggestions.
	7.	Coach reviews → approves or adjusts.
	8.	When DoD complete → gate unlocks → next Level available.

⸻

11) KPI Engine
	•	Manual entry or connected via APIs (GA4, Stripe, Shopify, Ads).
	•	KPI comparisons trigger insight rules (thresholds, trends, variances).
	•	Output = “suggested adjustments.”

Codex should scaffold function logic like:

IF (metric < target by 15%) THEN trigger_suggestion()


⸻

12) Stops & Gates

Each milestone includes Gate Criteria stored in Supabase:
	•	Required assets uploaded
	•	KPI threshold met
	•	Coach approval logged

“Stops” prevent progression if criteria fail.

⸻

13) Adaptive Suggestion Logic

The app uses deterministic rules to suggest optimizations:
	•	Low Opt-in → improve hook, simplify page, adjust traffic targeting.
	•	High CAC → test creative or down-funnel offers.
	•	High Churn → improve onboarding sequence, add save-offer.

Later, Codex or an LLM can learn from aggregated data to refine rule weighting.

⸻

14) Coach Review Flow
	1.	Client submits milestone.
	2.	Coach receives checklist and rubric.
	3.	Score (0–1) and notes saved in Supabase.
	4.	If pass ≥ threshold → unlock next step.

⸻

15) Notifications & Nudges
	•	Supabase triggers → push to client when KPI missing >7 days.
	•	Vercel Edge → sends scheduled “Mid-Sprint Pulse” summaries.
	•	Optional: mobile push (Expo).

⸻

16) Resource Library
	•	Templates for all four levels (JSON format).
	•	Copy banks, pricing frameworks, and offer checklists.
	•	Stored in Supabase Storage and accessible by role.

⸻

17) Supabase Function Hooks

Codex to generate edge functions for:
	•	onModelCreate: initialize plan and milestones.
	•	onKPIUpdate: evaluate thresholds and trigger suggestions.
	•	onMilestoneSubmit: verify gate completion.

⸻

18) UX Design Logic

Web: Dashboard → Models → Model Detail → Plan → Insights.
Mobile: Streamlined checklist + KPI entry.
Always surface: “Next Step,” “Why It Matters,” and “What Success Looks Like.”

⸻

19) AI Prompt Definitions
	•	Ideation: “Generate two BRM Level-specific model ideas given {industry, ICP, goal}.”
	•	Diagnosis: “Compare {actual vs target} KPIs; suggest 3 corrective experiments.”
	•	Coach Copilot: “Convert coach note into client-ready action tasks.”

Codex should scaffold prompt templates in /lib/ai/prompts/.

⸻

20) Integration Targets

Initial:
	•	GA4
	•	Stripe
	•	Shopify
	•	Meta & Google Ads

Secondary:
	•	HubSpot, Notion, ClickUp

⸻

21) Supabase Schema (Guiding Summary)

Tables:
clients, models, plans, milestones, tasks, kpis, suggestions, coach_notes, assets.

Relations:
	•	1:n from clients→models, models→plans, plans→milestones, etc.

RLS rules enforce org isolation.

⸻

22) Security
	•	Supabase Auth for all users.
	•	JWT with role claims.
	•	Row-Level Security for all queries.
	•	Audit logs in events table.
	•	Vercel serverless API protects AI endpoints via keys.

⸻

23) Deployment & CI/CD
	•	Repo → GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy on main branch.
	•	Supabase migrations run via GitHub Actions.
	•	.env.local includes API keys, project URLs, Supabase URL/Anon key.

⸻

24) Testing

Codex should generate:
	•	Unit tests for gate logic and suggestion triggers.
	•	Integration tests for Supabase → Frontend sync.
	•	Smoke tests post-deploy using Vercel Preview URLs.

⸻

25) Analytics

Admin dashboard to show:
	•	Active clients per Level.
	•	Completion % per milestone.
	•	KPI averages vs benchmarks.
	•	Suggestion adoption rate.

⸻

26) Branding & Copy

Tone: Confident, helpful, no jargon.
Language: Plain English with embedded guidance (“Here’s what to do next”).

⸻

27) Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
Readable type, strong contrast, mobile-first layout.

⸻

28) Performance

Target Core Web Vitals:
	•	LCP < 2.5s
	•	FID < 100ms
	•	CLS < 0.1

Supabase and Vercel provide caching and CDN distribution automatically.

⸻

29) Logging & Monitoring

	1.	Scaffold Supabase tables per schema outline.
	2.	Generate CRUD endpoints (Next.js API routes).
	3.	Include Edge Functions for triggers.
	4.	Build UI components (Dashboard, Model Builder, KPI Chart).
	5.	Maintain clean TypeScript typing.
	6.	Follow Level → Milestone → Gate logic exactly as described.
